- 👋 Helllooo, I’m @ando-ntn and people call me Xandrous in virtual world :)  i specialize in AI for Energy Management and Renewable Energy.
     feel free to call me either with Ando or Xandrous...
     5 words that describe me the most : Optimist, Unique Thinker, Curious, and Observant
     
- 👀 I’m obsessed with optimize and automate things, which lead me to learn Artificial Intelligence. i find it interesting especially Deep Learning which mimics how 
      human brain works and Reinforcement learning which give the robot or agent to learn about its environment without human supervising. if we combine both of it, 
      we get what we call as deep reinforcement learning and that is the thing that i've taken interest into lately for developing my product.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tensorflow from zero, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Internet of things, and Data processing.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that deploy Deep Learning or Reinforcement Learning like my product which we call it as S.E.C.O. or Smart Energy Consumption
      Optimizer that is used to decrease energy usage of Air Conditioner without decreasing the user's comfort level.

      more about me : 

      so basically, you could find me as someone normal on the outside but when it comes to problem solving, you could find me with multiple weird approach as
      i think differently to solve any kind of problems. 
      for example, in this case you have a Manual motorcycle or Car with Manual transmission with fuel consumption 30 km / Litre of fuel. if i ask you to increase the fuel 
      consumption efficiency, what will you do ? (please answer ths first before looking for my answer below :P )
    
    
      (my approach in this case is maintain your speed above 60 Kmph and then pull the clutch. it works :) from 30 km/litre which take me 2 weeks to empty my tank, now 
      it takes me 3 weeks to empty it. with that simple approach, i have increase the efficiency by 30 % !! with consideration of margin or error in my experiment) 
      why do i go with this approach ? i observed that whenever i pull the clutch for switching gears, i noticed that my speed is decreasing at much lower rate than 
      when i left it out with the gear intact. hence, i could reach longer distance with the same time needed.
